# KMP Project

> ⚠️ **Project Setup Instructions Outdated**    
> The instructions in *How To Set Up and Run the KMP Project.pdf* are outdated. Fleet IDE is no longer supported. Updated setup steps will be available before 14 June 2025.     
> **Side note:** Normally, setup instructions would be included in the README. However, because this project was originally submitted as a university assignment (where professors were unfamiliar with Markdown), the instructions were written in a PDF instead. The updated setup guide will be included directly in the README.
